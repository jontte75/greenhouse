# Omega2

This directory contains Omega2 related scripts and other source codes.

The Omega2 will be used as a minimal server for the Arduino, so that 
communications to outside world wil be done using Omega2 instead of Esp8266.
This is an attempt to tackle memory issues and instablility of the Arduino 
(But mostly an attempt to learn something new).

## Python

This directory contains different python scripts. In the beginning it'll 
most likely contain scripts for testing purposes, not yet connected to 
Arduino or the greenhouse project.
